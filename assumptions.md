Assumptions Made for This Case Study

1. Valid test users already exist for each tenant (company1 and company2).

2. API authentication tokens are available for test execution and do not
   expire during the test run.

3. Test data such as projects can be created and deleted using backend
   API calls.

4. The focus of this case study is on testing approach and reasoning,
   not on executing tests against a live environment.

5. BrowserStack or a similar cloud testing service is available for
   cross-browser and mobile validation.

6. Only critical user workflows are covered to keep execution time and
   cost reasonable.

7. CI/CD pipelines support environment variables for configuration.

8. Any test data created during execution is cleaned up after the test
   completes to avoid conflicts.
