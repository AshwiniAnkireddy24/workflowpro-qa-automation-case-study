QA Automation Case Study – WorkFlow Pro

This repository contains my approach to a QA automation case study for a
multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform.

The focus of this submission is not on running real tests, but on
demonstrating how I analyze flaky tests, design an automation framework,
and think about API and UI integration testing in a real-world setup.

Tools and Concepts Used:
- Playwright (UI automation)
- Pytest (test execution)
- API testing concepts
- Cross-browser and mobile testing (BrowserStack)
- CI/CD friendly automation practices

The repository is divided into three parts:
1. Flaky test analysis and fixes
2. Test framework design
3. API + UI integration testing approach

Assumptions made during the case study are documented separately.
